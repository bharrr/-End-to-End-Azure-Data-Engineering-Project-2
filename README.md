# -End-to-End-Azure-Data-Engineering-Project-2


## Introduction
In this project we are going to create an end to end data platform right from Data Ingestion, Data Transformation, Data Loading and Reporting. 

The use case for this project is building an end to end solution by ingesting the tables from on-premise SQL Server database using Azure Data Factory and then store the data in Azure Data Lake. Then Azure databricks is used to transform the RAW data to the most cleanest form of data and  finally using Microsoft Power BI to integrate with Azure synapse analytics to build an interactive dashboard.
